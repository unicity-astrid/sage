description: List the Astrid capsules installed in this runtime (the tool surface available over MCP).
allowed-tools: Bash(astrid capsule list:*)

List the installed Astrid capsules — these back the `mcp__astrid__*` tools this session can call.

!`astrid capsule list 2>/dev/null || echo "(unavailable — is the astrid CLI installed?)"`

Summarize which capability domains are available (filesystem, http, shell, system, skills, …) and which capsule provides each. Note that only capsules with tool handlers contribute callable tools.
