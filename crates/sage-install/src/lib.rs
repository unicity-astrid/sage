//! sage-install — per-principal Claude home provisioner.
//!
//! Triggered by `astrid sage install` (which publishes
//! `sage.v1.install.run`). For a given principal, this capsule:
//!
//! 1. Sanitises `principal_id` (rejects path-traversal, NULs, and any
//!    character outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`). The sanitised id is used for
//!    the KV install-complete key and surfaces in status events; it
//!    does NOT appear in fs paths because the kernel scopes the
//!    `home://` VFS scheme per-invocation-principal at check time
//!    (core/crates/astrid-kernel/src/lib.rs:75).
//! 2. Resolves home = `home://` (bound by the kernel to
//!    `~/.astrid/home/<principal>/`).
//! 3. Checks the KV idempotency marker `sage.install.complete.<id>` —
//!    short-circuits to a cached `sage.v1.install.complete` event
//!    unless `force=true`. On a cache-hit whose marker records an older
//!    `artifact_version` than this binary writes, the `.claude/` files
//!    are reconciled in place ONCE (headless only) before the
//!    short-circuit, so a pre-existing principal picks up a changed file
//!    shape (e.g. the registered `astrid mcp serve` `.mcp.json`) without
//!    a manual `--force`. See [`ARTIFACT_VERSION`].
//! 4. Creates `.claude/` and `.claude/projects/`.
//! 5. Atomically writes `.claude/settings.local.json` for the principal,
//!    shaped by the `PrincipalConfig` threaded over the IPC envelope.
//!    In `headless` interaction mode the allow list is pinned to
//!    `mcp__sage__*` and every built-in tool is denied; in `repl` mode
//!    the user owns their full Claude environment and the deny list is
//!    empty. In `api_key` auth mode `apiKeyHelper` is pinned to
//!    `/bin/false` so Claude cannot fall back to ambient creds; in
//!    `subscription` mode the helper is omitted so the keychain OAuth
//!    path is reachable. The `hooks` block is declared identically in
//!    both modes with `/bin/true` placeholders until the native bridge
//!    binary lands (see `crate::layout::settings_json` for the
//!    dual-mode contract).
//! 6. Atomically writes `.claude/.mcp.json`. In `headless` mode the
//!    body registers the `sage` MCP server as
//!    `astrid mcp serve --principal <id>` — the stdio server claude does
//!    the native MCP handshake against and calls `mcp__sage__*` tools
//!    against directly (see `crate::layout::mcp_json`). In `repl` mode
//!    the body is an empty `mcpServers` object — users wire native MCP
//!    servers themselves.
//! 7. Records `sage.install.complete.<id>` in KV and publishes
//!    `sage.v1.install.complete{success:true, home_path}`.
//!
//! # Runtime-rewrite contract
//!
//! `handle_relink` re-writes the two config files only; it never
//! prompts, never rotates secrets, and never touches the completion
//! marker. It IS the runtime-rewrite contract that sage drives whenever
//! `sage.v1.request.settings.set` mutates the per-principal config:
//! sage persists the merged `PrincipalConfig` in its KV namespace and
//! publishes `sage.v1.install.relink{principal_id, config}`; this
//! capsule consumes the envelope and rewrites the on-disk JSON so the
//! files on disk track the in-KV truth. A successful relink terminates
//! the cycle by republishing `sage.v1.install.complete`, which sage
//! treats as the cue to broadcast `sage.v1.settings.changed`. See the
//! README "Interaction modes" and "Authentication modes" sections for
//! the end-to-end walkthrough.
//!
//! NEVER runs `claude /login` — macOS Keychain entries are scoped by
//! service/account, not by `HOME`, so a per-principal `HOME` redirect
//! would still share OAuth across principals. The Anthropic key is
//! elicited at install time via the sibling `sage` crate's `[env]`
//! block (stored in the host SecretStore) and forwarded into the
//! `claude -p` subprocess as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at spawn time —
//! `sage` reads it back with `astrid_sdk::env::var("api_key")`.
//!
//! # Onboarding credential lifecycle (READ BEFORE EDITING)
//!
//! Initial-setup credentials (the Anthropic API key, model id, any
//! other per-principal config) come from the **sibling `sage` crate's
//! `[env]` block in its `Capsule.toml`** — NOT from `elicit::*` in
//! this capsule. The kernel elicits each declared `[env]` value at
//! capsule install time, persists it in its SecretStore, and injects
//! it as the capsule's runtime config; `sage` reads it back via
//! `astrid_sdk::env::var("api_key")` at spawn time. See
//! `capsules/astrid-capsule-openai/Capsule.toml` for the canonical
//! `[env]` schema (`type = "secret" | "string" | "integer"`,
//! `request`, optional `default` / `placeholder`).
//!
//! The runtime `astrid_sdk::elicit::*` module is for one-shot dynamic
//! prompts, NOT initial onboarding. The host gates `astrid:elicit@1.0.0`
//! to `#[astrid::install]` / `#[astrid::upgrade]` lifecycle phases —
//! calling it from an IPC interceptor returns `not-in-lifecycle` and
//! the install fails loudly. Do not re-introduce an `elicit::secret`
//! call from a subscribed-IPC handler in this crate; declare the
//! credential under `[env]` in the consuming capsule's manifest
//! instead.
