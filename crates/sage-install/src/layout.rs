///   the commands themselves (and, for hooks, the per-spawn token sage's
///   validator checks), not on this file being tamper-proof.

/// Branching is driven by the two axes in [`PrincipalConfig`]:
///
/// * [`InteractionMode::Headless`]: sage drives the loop. The allow list
///   is [`NATIVE_ALLOW`] (Claude's dev tools + the sage MCP surface), the
///   escape surface in [`REQUIRED_DENIES`] is denied, `permissions.defaultMode`
///   is `dontAsk` (auto-deny the rest, no prompt), the `sandbox` block bounds
///   Claude's native tools, and `disableSkillShellExecution` blocks the skill
///   shell path.
/// * [`InteractionMode::Repl`]: the user drives `claude` directly. Allow
///   and deny lists are empty (user owns their full Claude environment)
///   and `disableSkillShellExecution` is omitted.
/// * [`AuthMode::ApiKey`]: `apiKeyHelper` is pinned to `/bin/false` so
///   `claude` cannot fall back to ambient creds — the per-principal
///   secret is forwarded as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the spawn env.
/// * [`AuthMode::Subscription`]: `apiKeyHelper` is omitted entirely so
///   `claude` can use its keychain OAuth path. Caveat (macOS): the
///   keychain entry is keyed by service+account, not by `HOME`, so two
///   principals on the same macOS user share the OAuth token. Use
///   api_key mode (or separate macOS users) for full per-principal
///   isolation. Linux libsecret is namespaced by user session and is
///   unaffected.
///
/// The `hooks` block is **identical in both modes** — declared, not

/// `defaultMode`, sandbox, `disableSkillShellExecution`, `apiKeyHelper`) but
/// narrows `hooks` to ONLY the binding policy gate
/// ([`pretooluse_gate_handler`]). Rationale:
///
/// * The managed tier carries only what must be UN-STRIPPABLE. The
///   observe-only `astrid-emit` plane is best-effort audit and stays in the
///   (session-overridable) local tier — no need to duplicate 30 fire-and-
///   forget hooks into the managed file.
/// * Claude MERGES hooks across tiers and deduplicates `mcp_tool` handlers by
///   `(server, tool, input)`. The gate here is byte-identical to its local
///   copy, so the two collapse and the gate fires EXACTLY ONCE — even when
///   both tiers are present. Stripping the local copy leaves the managed one
///   standing; that is the whole point.
/// * Permission `allow`/`deny` union across tiers and `deny` is sticky (a
///   higher-tier allow cannot cancel a lower-tier deny), so the managed
///   `deny` surface ([`REQUIRED_DENIES`]) and the `dontAsk` floor become
///   un-strippable, and `apiKeyHelper` (when api-key mode) becomes an
///   un-strippable auth lockdown.

/// posture + gate; repl gets the operator's gate over an otherwise
/// user-owned permission surface.
