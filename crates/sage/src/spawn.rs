//! Building the `claude -p` subprocess.
//!
//! Centralises the hardened argv + env we feed [`process::Command`].
//! Every flag here matters: dropping `--strict-mcp-config` smuggles in
//! `.mcp.json` from the redirected HOME; dropping `--permission-mode
//! dontAsk` lets a tool prompt (and hang the terminal-less `-p` session)
//! instead of fail-secure auto-denying; dropping `--sandbox` removes
//! Claude's inner bound on its native tools (the Astrid host sandbox still
//! binds, but defense-in-depth is lost); etc.
//!
//! Native-tools model: Claude uses its OWN tools (Bash/Read/Write/Edit/…),
//! sandboxed — NOT Astrid capsule-tool replacements. The escape /
//! orchestration surface stays denied; the dev tools are allow-listed.
//!
//! Enforcement lives in the argv on purpose. Claude's tier precedence is
//! `Managed > CLI args > Local (settings.local.json) > Project > User`.
//! CLI args are the only session-un-overridable tier reachable from
//! capsule-space — sage owns the full argv and execs `claude` directly,
//! so anything expressed as a flag here sits above every on-disk file
//! tier and a running session cannot edit it away. Two flags carry that
//! weight: `--disallowedTools` hoists the deny list out of the Local
//! tier (`settings.local.json`, fully session-overridable) into the
//! binding CLI tier, and `--setting-sources local` narrows on-disk tier
//! loading to just sage's own authored file so a stray `user`/`project`
//! settings file cannot dilute the posture. Managed and CLI flags always
//! load regardless of `--setting-sources`, so the narrowing only shrinks
//! the overridable surface; it never weakens the managed tier.
