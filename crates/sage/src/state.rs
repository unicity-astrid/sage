//! Per-session state: persisted KV records and live in-memory runtime.
//!
//! Two layers of state coexist:
//!
//! - [`SessionRecord`] — JSON, persisted to KV under `sage.session.<sid>`
//!   keyed by session_id. Survives capsule unload; the records are the
//!   recovery list scanned on supervisor start.
//! - [`RuntimeSession`] — live in-memory state: the
//!   [`process::PersistentProcess`] resource handle (a kernel resource
//!   NOT serializable to KV) plus the stream-json line decoder buffer.
//!   Held in a [`Mutex<HashMap>`] inside the capsule singleton; dies on
//!   capsule reload.
//!
//! On reload the persisted records survive but their in-memory
//! [`PersistentProcess`](process::PersistentProcess) handles do not.
//! Because the `claude -p` children run on the persistent tier they
//! usually OUTLIVE the reload, so the supervisor's first-tick reconcile
//! re-[`attach`](astrid_sdk::process::attach)es by
//! [`SessionRecord::process_id`] and resumes driving each survivor;
//! genuinely-dead children reconcile to a real `exited` (or `lost`) and
//! their records are cleared. See [`crate::supervisor`].
