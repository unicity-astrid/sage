//! Cooperative supervisor for live `claude -p` subprocesses.
//!
//! The supervisor is the body of `#[astrid::run]`. Every ~50 ms it:
//!
//! 1. Drains stdout from every active session, feeding bytes into the
//!    session's [`codec::LineDecoder`].
//! 2. Dispatches every decoded envelope to the matching
//!    `sage.v1.event.<sid>.*` IPC topic.
//! 3. Detects process crash / buffer overflow / capsule reload and
//!    publishes synthetic `exited` events so consumers don't hang.
//!
//! Tool execution is NOT sage's job. Claude calls the registered `astrid
//! mcp serve` MCP server directly over the MCP protocol, so tool calls
//! never round-trip through the supervisor. The supervisor only relays
//! the conversation stream (init / text / done / partial) onto the
//! `sage.v1.event.<sid>.*` topics; `tool_use` blocks and control requests
//! are observe-only.
