//! Hook-event-bridge primitives: per-session token mint / persist /
//! lookup / forget, constant-time token compare, and the canonical
//! Claude-hook → Astrid-topic mapping.
//!
//! Wired end-to-end: `handle_spawn` (lib.rs) mints + persists tokens
//! and sets `ASTRID_HOOK_TOKEN`/`ASTRID_PRINCIPAL_ID`/`ASTRID_SESSION_ID`
//! on the `claude` child env; the `#[astrid::run]` supervisor subscribes
//! to `sage.v1.hook.*` and routes each event through
//! `lookup_token` + `tokens_match` + canonical-topic republish;
//! `shutdown::stop_session` and `supervisor::evict` call `forget_token`
//! on every session-end path. See unicity-astrid/astrid#814 (binary) and
//! rfcs#30 (capability-token forward direction) for the broader design
//! and the residual Linux env-stealability gap.
//!
//! ## Threat model
//!
//! The native `astrid-emit` binary (shipping separately in core) reads
//! a per-session token from the spawned `claude -p` process env
//! (`ASTRID_HOOK_TOKEN`) and includes it in every published
//! `sage.v1.hook.*` event. Sage's run loop looks the token
//! up in KV at `sage.hook_token.<principal>.<session>` and only
//! republishes on the canonical `hook.v1.event.*` topics when the
//! claimed token matches the stored one.
//!
//! Token compare is constant-time to avoid a same-host timing oracle
//! even though the practical threat is bounded to other processes
//! sharing the same env (Linux residual env-stealability — see RFC#30
//! capability-token migration).
